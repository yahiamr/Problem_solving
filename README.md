# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Guide

## Introduction
This study guide is meticulously crafted to align with the Neetcode Roadmap. It offers a structured approach to mastering data structures and algorithms, with each section providing targeted learning and practice recommendations.

## Study Categories

### Arrays & Hashing
  - Dive into array-based problems, exploring techniques for sorting, searching, and optimizing space with hashing. Understand how to handle duplicates, anagrams, and array transformation challenges.

### Two Pointers
  - Develop skills for problems that require simultaneous tracking of two positions, typically to find pairs or subarrays that meet certain criteria without the need for nested loops.

### Sliding Window
  - Master the sliding window technique for efficiently solving problems that involve contiguous sequences of elements, such as finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Stack
  - Utilize the stack data structure to implement algorithms for evaluating expressions, navigating directories, and maintaining history, emphasizing Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior.

### Binary Search
  - Leverage binary search algorithms for quick and efficient data retrieval in sorted arrays or search spaces, reducing time complexity significantly.

### Linked List
  - Engage with single and doubly linked lists, solving problems related to insertion, deletion, and reversal. Tackle challenges such as detecting cycles and merging lists.

### Trees
  - Explore binary trees, binary search trees, n-ary trees, and balanced trees. Focus on traversal techniques, node insertion and deletion, and solving common problems like path sum and tree balancing.

### Tries
  - Understand the implementation and application of tries for prefix-based search operations, word validations, and auto-complete features.

### Heap / Priority Queue
  - Utilize heaps for efficient sorting and priority queue operations. Solve problems involving scheduling, median finding, and stream processing.

### Backtracking
  - Approach combinatorial problems using backtracking by building solutions incrementally and abandoning paths that do not lead to a solution.

### Graphs
  - Study the representation, traversal, and analysis of graphs. Cover both directed and undirected graphs, and solve problems involving cycle detection, connectivity, and topological sorting.

### Advanced Graphs
  - Delve into complex graph algorithms such as shortest path finding with Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford, minimum spanning trees with Prim's and Kruskal's, and flow networks with Ford-Fulkerson.

### 1-D Dynamic Programming
  - Learn dynamic programming to optimize recursive algorithms, solving problems such as fibonacci sequence, longest increasing subsequence, and knapsack optimization.

### 2-D Dynamic Programming
  - Extend dynamic programming techniques to two-dimensional data structures, solving complex problems like matrix chain multiplication and edit distance.

### Greedy
  - Apply greedy algorithms to find local optima and solve problems that require choices like interval scheduling, Huffman encoding, and coin change.

### Intervals
  - Solve interval problems, understanding how to manipulate and analyze overlapping intervals, interval merging, and interval partitioning.

### Math & Geometry
  - Address problems requiring mathematical reasoning and geometric computation, covering prime numbers, statistical operations, and coordinate geometry.

### Bit Manipulation
  - Use bit manipulation for memory-efficient algorithms, bitwise operations, and to solve problems that involve bit manipulation tricks and techniques.
